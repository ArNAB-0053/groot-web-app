# Plant Disease Detection System - Groot ðŸŒ¿

Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection System! This project leverages deep learning techniques to identify various diseases in plant leaves. 

## Overview

This system consists of:
- **Model Training**: Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras, I trained a deep learning model with a remarkable 95% accuracy rate.
- **API Integration**: Using Flask, I transformed the trained model into a RESTful API for seamless integration.
- **Web Application**: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, the web app provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive instant disease diagnosis.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Diagnosis**: The model is capable of identifying a wide range of plant diseases with impressive accuracy.
- **Fast Performance**: With just 3 epochs of training, the model achieves exceptional results, making it efficient and reliable.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Users receive detailed information about diagnosed diseases, including symptoms and management recommendations.
