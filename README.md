# Plant Disease Detection System - Groot ðŸŒ¿

Welcome to the Groot. Groot is a plant leaf disease detection system based on deep learning. It has a training accuracy of 99% and a validation accuracy of 97%, using a model trained with TensorFlow and Keras. The trained model is integrated into a RESTful API with Flask. The system is then developed into a web application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. 

## Overview

This system consists of:
- **Model Training**: Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras, I trained a deep learning model with over 95% accuracy rate.
- **API Integration**: Using Flask, I transformed the trained model into a RESTful API for seamless integration.
- **Web Application**: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, the web app provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive instant disease diagnosis.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Diagnosis**: It diagnoses variety of plant diseases with a high degree of accuracy.
- **Health Assessment**: It tells whether the plant is healthy or not.
- **Disease Identification**: Identifies specific diseases that are affecting the plant.
- **Detailed insights**: In case the plant is not healthy, it provides information on the symptoms and management recommendations.
